## ✨ Features 

This project enhances the traditional Space Invaders gameplay with three major innovative systems:

### 1. 🧱 Physics & Debris System 
The world is no longer static.
- **Dynamic Wreckage:** Destroyed invaders don't just vanish—they turn into burnt-out "dark matter" debris that physically falls to the ground.
- **Interaction:** The player's ship can push through piles of wreckage.
- **Gravity:** Missed bullets and debris react to gravity, piling up on the floor.

### 2. 🛡️ Umbrella Shield 
A defensive power-up triggered by destroying the **UFO**.
- **Ricochet Physics:** Deploys a physical mesh shield for 5 seconds that bounces enemy bullets away with a satisfying metallic sound.
- **Invulnerability:** Provides a brief window to play aggressively.

### 3. ⏳ Time Slow Mechanic 
Control the flow of battle by catching the rare **Clock** item.
- **Matrix Style:** Slows down the entire enemy matrix and projectiles to **10% speed**.
- **Tactical Advantage:** Gives you 5 seconds of precision movement to dodge impossible bullet patterns.
